    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects acts as the backbone for data modeling and manipulation. Behind their intuitive syntax lies a captivating internal representation that governs their behavior. In this brief exploration, we'll unravel the internal workings of objects in JavaScript, shedding light on the mechanisms that make them so powerful.
    </p>
<p>JavaScript objects are dynamic entities, encapsulating data and functionality through key-value pairs. These pairs, known as properties, can hold various data types, creating a versatile structure. Objects may also contain methods, enabling encapsulation and interaction with the object's internal state.
</p>
<h3>Internal Representation</h3>

<p>Objects dynamically allocate memory to store their properties and methods.
This flexible memory allocation allows for the dynamic addition or removal of properties during the object's lifecycle.
</p>
<h3>Prototypes and Inheritance:</h3>

<p>JavaScript embraces a prototype-based inheritance model.
Objects have an internal link to a prototype, forming a chain. If a property is not found, JavaScript traverses the chain to locate it.
</p>
<h3>Object Descriptors:</h3>

<p>Each property has an associated object descriptor, defining attributes like writability and configurability.
Object descriptors empower developers to fine-tune property behavior.
