                        <p> In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, each request/response transaction requires a separate connection. This means that if a webpage has multiple resources (images, scripts, stylesheets), each of these resources is fetched sequentially, leading to potential latency issues.</p>

                        <p> One of the major improvements in HTTP/2 is the introduction of multiplexing. With multiplexing, multiple requests and responses can be sent and received in parallel over a single connection. This significantly reduces latency and speeds up the loading of web pages.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>  HTTP/2 features header compression, reducing the size of headers and, consequently, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. This optimization helps improve overall performance and reduces latency.</p></td>

                    <td>
                        <p>  HTTP/2 introduces the concept of stream prioritization. This allows the server to prioritize the delivery of critical resources, such as the main HTML document, ensuring a faster and more efficient loading process.</p></td>

                        <p>  In the traditional model, the client initiates requests for resources. If the server wants to send additional resources that were not explicitly requested, it has to wait for the client to request them.</p></td>
                    <td>
                        <p> Server Push is a feature that enables the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested. This can reduce the number of round trips and further accelerate page loading times.</p></td>
